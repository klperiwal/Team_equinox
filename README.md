# ALPHATYPS

AFTER THIS LOCDOWN PERIOD MANY PEOPLE ESPECIALLY CHILDREN ARE CONSTANTLY IN TOUCH WITH THE SCREENS…THEY JUST SURF N PLAY SOME RANDOM GAMES WITHOUT THE KNOWLEGDE OF THEIR SIDE EFFECTS ON THEM!!WHY CANT WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS?? 

WE HAVE CREATED A SPECIAL GAME  “ *ALPHATYPES* ”  WHICH CAN BE PLAYED  ANYTIME  ANYWHERE  BY THE PEOPLE!!NOT ONLY IT ENHANCES THE TYPING SKILLS OF THE PEOPLE BUT ALSO GIVE THEM FEEDBACK HOW THEY CAN IMPROVE THEIR SPEEDS. THE GAME ALSO IMPROVES THE USERS CONCENTRATION POWER.
THE SCOREBOARD APPEARS AT THE END OF THE GMAE ALONG WITH A VIRTUAL FEEDBACK BOX WITH THE MESSAGE OF SCOPE OF IMPROVEMENT FOR THE PERSON. 

WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS GAME SIMPLE FAST AND EFFECTIVE..
HENCE WE HAVE DECIDED TO USE THE MOST EFFECTIVE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE-C LANGUAGE.

THE CODE IS WRITTEN ENTIRELY IN C LANGUAGE TO KEEP IT RELATIVELY FASTER AND USER FRIENDLY.
